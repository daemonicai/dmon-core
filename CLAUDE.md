# daemon — Project Instructions

## What this project is

daemon is a .NET-native coding agent inspired by [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). It is written in **C# on .NET 10**. The agent core runs as a separate process over JSONL/stdio. Two host surfaces are planned: a console/TUI host and an Avalonia desktop host.

See [`coding-agent-brief.md`](./coding-agent-brief.md) for the full vision and architectural rationale.

## Tech stack

- **Language:** C# 13 / .NET 10
- **LLM abstraction:** `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` (`IChatClient`) — see ADR-001
- **Extension model:** Two tiers — `.csx` scripts (hot-loaded) and NuGet packages via `AssemblyLoadContext` — see ADR-002
- **RPC protocol:** JSONL over stdio, Pi-compatible shape — see ADR-003
- **Session storage:** Relocatable directory with `messages.jsonl` + `meta.json` + `attachments/` — see ADR-004
- **Provider auth:** API keys via env vars or config file — see ADR-005
- **Permission model:** Tiered prompts (read/write/bash/network), conservative by default — see ADR-006

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs in [`docs/adrs/`](./docs/adrs/) are **binding**. Accepted ADRs must not be contradicted by code or proposals. If new information warrants reconsidering a decision, write a new ADR with status **Supersedes: ADR-NNN** and get it accepted before implementing the change.

Key accepted decisions:

| ADR | Decision |
|-----|----------|
| ADR-001 | Use `IChatClient` (M.E.AI) for LLM abstraction. No MAF dependency. |
| ADR-002 | Extensions expose `AIFunction` via `IDaemonExtension`. No wrapper interface. |
| ADR-003 | JSONL over stdio, Pi-compatible protocol shape. Not strict JSON-RPC 2.0. |
| ADR-004 | Session = relocatable directory. `messages.jsonl` append-only. Large outputs in `attachments/`. |
| ADR-005 | API keys only (env or config). No OAuth for V1. |
| ADR-006 | Conservative permission model. Read within CWD is implicit; all writes require a prompt. |

New ADRs belong in `docs/adrs/ADR-NNN-<slug>.md`. Use the existing ADRs as the format template.

## OpenSpec workflow

All planned changes go through the OpenSpec workflow in [`openspec/`](./openspec/).

### Proposing a change

Use `/opsx:propose` to create a new change. This generates a proposal, design, spec, and task list under `openspec/changes/<slug>/`.

### Implementing a change

Use `/opsx:apply` to work through the tasks for a change. Tasks are organised into groups in `openspec/changes/<slug>/tasks.md`. Process **one group at a time**, and for each group:

1. Spawn the `worker` agent to implement the tasks in that group — and only that group. Do not let the worker stray into later groups.
2. Spawn the `reviewer` agent to review the resulting changes.
3. If the reviewer requests changes, send the worker back in to address them. Loop until the reviewer approves.
4. Once approved, `git commit` the changes (Conventional Commits format, scoped to the group) and `git push`.
5. Only then move on to the next group of tasks.

Mark tasks completed in `tasks.md` as the worker finishes them.

### Archiving a change

Use `/opsx:archive` once all tasks are done and the code is merged. This moves the change to `openspec/changes/archive/`.

### Rules

- Do not implement features that have no corresponding OpenSpec change unless they are clearly in-scope for an active change.
- Do not leave changes in a partial state — either complete the tasks or document why a task was deferred.
- The `openspec/specs/` directory holds standing specs (interfaces, protocols, schemas). Keep these in sync with the ADRs.

## Build and test

> These commands will be added once the project has a buildable solution. Update this section when the first `.sln` is added.

Expected conventions (fill in when ready):

```
dotnet build          # build all projects
dotnet test           # run all tests
dotnet run --project src/Daemon.Console   # run the console host
```

All code must build without warnings. Treat warnings as errors (`<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>`).

---

## Code style

- Follow standard C# conventions (PascalCase types/members, camelCase locals/params).
- Async methods end in `Async`. Cancellation tokens are always the last parameter and always named `cancellationToken`.
- Prefer `record` for immutable data, `class` for mutable state.
- No `var` when the type is not obvious from the right-hand side.
- No comments that restate what the code does. Only comment non-obvious constraints or workarounds.
- Interfaces are prefixed `I`. No other prefixes or suffixes.
- File-scoped namespaces (`namespace Foo;`) throughout.

---

## Commits

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`.
- Scope is the component: `feat(session):`, `fix(rpc):`, `docs(adr):`, etc.
- Subject line in imperative mood, no period, max 72 characters.
- Reference the OpenSpec change slug in the body if the commit is part of a change: `Change: daemon-core`.

## Pi coding agent — specific instructions

The Pi agent (`earendil-works/pi`) uses the skills in `.pi/skills/` and prompts in `.pi/prompts/`. These mirror the Claude Code OpenSpec skills.

### What the Pi agent should do

- Use `/opsx:explore` to think through a problem before proposing.
- Use `/opsx:propose` to create a new OpenSpec change.
- Use `/opsx:apply` to implement tasks from an active change.
- Use `/opsx:archive` to finalise a completed change.

### What the Pi agent must not do

- Must not modify accepted ADRs without writing a superseding ADR first.
- Must not implement features outside an active OpenSpec change (except trivial single-line fixes).
- Must not `git push` or create PRs without explicit user instruction.
- Must not skip build warnings or disable `TreatWarningsAsErrors`.
- Must not take a dependency on Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) — ADR-001 rules this out.

### Session and RPC

- The Pi agent communicates over JSONL/stdio (ADR-003 shape). Commands use `{"id": "...", "type": "...", ...params}`. Events use `{"id": "...", "event": "...", ...payload}`.
- Do not invent new RPC message types without updating the spec in `openspec/specs/`.

### Provider configuration

- Provider credentials are read from env vars (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`) or a config file. Do not hard-code keys or commit them.

## Out of scope for V1

Do not implement, propose, or accept tasks for these unless the brief is explicitly updated:

- Multi-agent orchestration
- Avalonia desktop host
- Skill marketplace / discovery service
- Remote agent execution
- Mobile hosts
- OAuth authentication (noted stretch goal for Gemini/Vertex only)
